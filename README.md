# Exercise Set 01

This repository contains practice exercises for the [Client-Side Web Development](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1118282) course at the UW iSchool.

To complete this exercise, follow the instructions detailed [on the assignment page](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1118282/assignments/3818107).

## Checking Your Work
This exercise comes with a suite of _unit tests_ that you can use to check your work and understanding. Tests are **not** guaranteed to be comprehensive.

In order to run these tests, you will need to have the [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) test runner installed globally:

```bash
npm install -g jest
```

You will also need to install the test dependencies listed in the `package.json` file:

```bash
npm install
```

You can run these tests by using the `jest` command from the repo's root directory, or by using `npm test`:

```bash
# run tests for problem1
jest problem1
```
